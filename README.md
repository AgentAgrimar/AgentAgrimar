Hello, I'm Agrimar. I've been a programmer for a number of (mainly Source) games and mods.

I do various gameplay, UI, backend, etc. systems programming for games and mods.

My repositories are split up into ~~categories~~ organizations:

- [Modifications](https://github.com/AG-Modifications)  
  Various modifications for whichever, whether it be for Garry's Mod or Minecraft.
- [GameMaker](https://github.com/AG-GameMaker)  
  Spontaneous ideas I've had for GameMaker projects.
- [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/AG-UnrealEngine)  
  Spontaneous ideas I've had for Unreal Engine 4/5 projects.
- Forks  
  An archive of my contributions to/derivatives of other people's code.
